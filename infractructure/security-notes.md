Several basic security measures:

Access and Identity Management:

Do not use SMS for two-factor authentication (may be compromised by the mobile operator)
Use roles and policies to control access to Terraform resources
Restrict access to the cluster using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Network Settings:

Configure network policies to restrict traffic between pods.
Set up Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups (NSG) to filter inbound and outbound traffic.

Encryption and Secret Management:

Encrypt data at rest using Azure Disk Encryption.
Use Azure Key Vault to securely store secrets and configuration data.
Configure TLS/SSL to encrypt traffic.

Monitoring and Logging:

Enable cluster monitoring using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
Set up alerts and notifications to track suspicious activity.
Log all actions through Azure Activity Logs and Kubernetes Audit Logs.

Container Security Management:

Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
Use signed images and verify their authenticity.
Limit container privileges and apply security policies (Pod Security Policies).

Updating and Patching:

Regularly update and patch the AKS cluster and nodes.
Automate updates using Terraform and CI/CD processes.

CI/CD Configuration:

Ensure the security of CI/CD processes for the ARC runner, not use persistent runners as a possibly.
Use secrets and environment variables to securely store configurations.
Perform security checks of source code and configurations using static code analysis tools.
